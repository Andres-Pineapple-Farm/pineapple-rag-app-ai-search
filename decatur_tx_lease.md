THIS LEASE, is entered into as of this

17

day of April, 2008 (the "Effective Date"),

by and between Decatur Midstar, Ltd, a Texas limited partnership, 1848 Norwood Plaza, Suite 214, Hurst,

Texas 76054, as landlord ("Landlord"), and Tractor Supply Company, a Delaware corporation, 200

Powell Place, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027, as tenant ("Tenant").

1.

DEMISED PREMISES. Landlord represents and warrants that it owns lawful fee simple

title to those certain premises, located at 1200 Highway 51, in the City of Decatur, County of Wise, State

of Texas, and more particularly described in the legal description attached hereto and made a part hereof

as Exhibit "A" (the "Shopping Center"). The Shopping Center contains a gross leaseable area of

65,545 square feet ("Leaseable Area"). The Leaseable Area shall be adjusted from time to time for any

increase or decrease in building sizes of buildings located within the Shopping Center. Landlord hereby

leases to Tenant, on the terms and conditions contained in this Lease, that portion of the Shopping

Center containing approximately 31,745 square feet of interior building space (the "Building"), together

with "Permanent Sidewalk Display Area", "Permanent Trailer and Equipment Display Area" (7,040

sq. ft.), loading docks, and a fenced outdoor display area of approximately 9,600 square feet (the

"Fenced Outdoor Display Area") (collectively, the "Demised Premises"), as shown outlined in red on

the Site Plan attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit "B".

2.

CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS BY LANDLORD. Landlord covenants that it

shall furnish and complete, at its sole cost and expense, all of the materials, labor, equipment, tools and

supervision, and shall do everything necessary to renovate to Tenant's specifications and approval, the

Permanent Trailer and Equipment Display Area, as shown on the Site Plan (collectively, the

"Improvements"). Landlord shall renovate and construct a concrete pad of approximately 7,040 square

feet North of the Building over an existing concrete drainage ditch (which shall be used as Tenant's

Permanent Trailer and Equipment Display Area) and provide plans for Tenant's approval prior to

construction. Tenant's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Until such time as this

Permanent Trailer and Equipment Display Area is constructed, Tenant shall continue to utilize all Outdoor

Display Areas it is currently using, but after the concrete pad is constructed Tenant shall have no storage

or display rights other than as shown on Exhibit "B".

3.

CONSTRUCTION PLANS.

A. Tenant Initial Approved Plans. Landlord shall furnish Tenant or Tenant's designee, at

Landlord's sole cost and expense, design drawings and specifications for the Improvements ("Landlord's

Proposed Plans"). Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of Landlord's Proposed Plans to

approve or disapprove such plans in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant's

approval may include modifications to Landlord's Proposed Plans. Tenant's approval of Landlord's

Proposed Plans means only that Landlord's Proposed Plans meet the requirements of Tenant, and do not

indicate, and should not be construed by Landlord as indicating, required governmental approvals or legal

compliance, which are at the cost and obligation of Landlord. The plans as approved by Tenant, if at all,

shall be referred to as the "Tenant Approved Plans".

Tenant's failure to approve or disapprove Landlord's Proposed Plans within thirty (30)

days of receipt shall not mean that Tenant approves or disapproves such plans, and Landlord agrees not

to construe Tenant's failure to approve in such fashion. Tenant's period of time to approve or disapprove

Landlord's plans shall be reasonably extended upon request by Tenant.

If Tenant disapproves Landlord's Proposed Plans, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing

the reasons for Tenant's disapproval. Landlord, at its sole cost and expense, and within thirty (30) days

from receipt of Tenant's disapproval of such plans, shall revise Landlord's Proposed Plans to satisfy

Tenant's objections, in which case the revised plans shall be the Tenant Approved Plans.

Decatur, TX FINAL LEASE

B.

Governmental Approved Plans. Tenant shall present the Tenant Approved

Plans, for approval, to all governmental agencies having jurisdiction over the Improvements and whose

approval is required. The plans as approved and stamped by such governmental agencies shall be

referred to as the "Governmental Approved Plans".

If within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date (i) Tenant cannot, despite using its

commercially reasonable efforts, obtain all required governmental approvals for use of the Outdoor

Display Areas, or (ii) the governmental agencies require such changes to the Outdoor Display Areas or

their specifications such that the Outdoor Display Areas would not be economically feasible as

determined by Tenant in its reasonable discretion, or (iii) the governmental agencies require such

changes to the Outdoor Display Areas or their specifications such that they would not meet Tenant's

requirements as determined by Tenant in its reasonable discretion, Tenant may immediately terminate

this Lease by delivery of written notice to Landlord within such sixty (60) day period (together with

reasonably sufficient information setting forth Tenant's termination) and upon such termination the Prior

Lease dated August 28, 1995 between Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Landlord's predecessor) and Tenant ("Prior

Lease") shall be reinstated as if same had never been terminated, and any sums received by Landlord

from Tenant under this Lease in excess of the amounts which would have been paid by Tenant under the

Prior Lease shall be credited against the next installment of Fixed Rent due under the Prior Lease.

ZONING AND PERMITS. Landlord shall (i) secure and pay for all permits required for

construction of the Improvements and (ii) pay for all fees in connection with construction of the

Improvements. Landlord shall post all bonds, secure and pay for all permits, and pay all fees for

construction of the Improvements on or in connection with public property.

Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant that upon the Effective Date, Tenant shall

have the uninhibited right to use the Demised Premises, including all outdoor display areas as identified

in Exhibit "B" (on sidewalks and in existing parking or other Common Areas) for its intended use. As

such, Landlord shall be responsible to secure any and all consents, waivers and/or amendments which

may be required to allow Tenant's use under any existing title encumbrance, including but not limited to,

any lease, easement, reciprocal access agreement, restrictions, exclusive use provisions, or other

covenants. Tenant shall be responsible for obtaining the approval of all governmental agencies as

required to use the outdoor display areas.

7.

CONSTRUCTION INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to Landlord's indemnification in

Subsection 21 A, Landlord shall protect, indemnify and save harmless Tenant, its affiliates, and each of

their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives, agents, and assignees

(individually and collectively, the "Tenant Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, demands,

actions, causes of action, suits, judgments, liability, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees,

experts' fees, court costs, and other proceeding costs), and damages arising or growing out of any failure

to act, or omission on the part of Landlord or those acting on behalf of Landlord in any manner arising out

of or connected with the construction of the Improvements during the period of construction.

Landlord's indemnification of the Tenant Indemnitees is one of first defense and payment,

not of reimbursement or surety. Landlord's indemnification of the Tenant Indemnitees shall in no way be

limited by or to Landlord's insurance.

8.

INSPECTION OF WORK. Tenant shall at all times have access to and the right to

inspect construction of the Improvements and the elements thereof, wherever and by whomever same

WORKMANSHIP OF IMPROVEMENTS/WARRANTY.

All materials and equipment

items shall be new and of the quality specified in the Tenant Approved Plans. The Improvements shall be

constructed in a good and workmanlike manner and shall comply in all respects with the Tenant

Approved Plans, all lawful requirements applicable to the Demised Premises and the Permitted

Encumbrances.

Landlord shall remedy, at its sole cost and expense, any defects in the Improvements

due to faulty materials or workmanship and pay for any damage to other work resulting from such defects

and/or the remedying thereof. Neither the foregoing nor any other provision in this Lease, shall limit

Landlord's liability for defects or installations resulting from deliberate or other deviations from the plans

and specifications to less than the legal limit of liability under the law of the jurisdiction where the

Demised Premises are located. Tenant shall give Landlord notice of observed defects with reasonable

promptness. Should Landlord fail to replace or remedy the defective work within thirty (30) days following

notice from Tenant, then Tenant shall give a second notice to Landlord, and if Landlord does not, within

five (5) days after receipt of the second notice, replace or remedy the defective work, then after the

expiration of the second five (5) day period, Tenant shall have the right to make such corrections and

Landlord expressly authorizes Tenant to offset the cost thereof against future Fixed Rent payments,

provided Tenant's offset right shall be limited to no more than thirty-five percent (35%) of any single

installment of Fixed Rent unless said Fixed Rent offset occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the

Initial Term or last twelve (12) months of any Extension Term, wherein Tenant shall be authorized to

offset any rent payments, Fixed or otherwise, until it has been reimbursed for all costs and expenses

associated with correcting defects in the Improvements as set forth above.

other things as may be reasonably required to authorize such electronic fund transfers.

15.

EXCLUSIVE USE COVENANT. So long as Tenant is not in default under the Lease for

which a judgment of default has been rendered in favor of Landlord, and Tenant or Tenant's assignee or

sublessee is utilizing the Demised Premises for the uses set forth in clauses (a) - (p) of this Section, and

Tenant continues to conduct business within the market, the Landlord covenants and agrees not to sell,

lease, rent, occupy or allow to be occupied, or otherwise transfer or convey all or any portion of the

Restricted Property, as such term is defined below, for the purpose of selling or offering for sale those

items which support a farm/ranch/rural/do-it-yourself lifestyle including: (a) tractor and equipment repair

and maintenance supplies; (b) farm fencing; (c) livestock gates; (d) livestock feeding systems; (e) animal

feed and health/maintenance products for pets or livestock (including but not limited to: dog, cat, bird,

horse, cattle, goat, pig, fowl, rabbits, equine and livestock); (f) western wear and boots; (g) outdoor work

wear (similar to and specifically including Carhartt products) and boots; (h) horse and rider tack and

equipment; (i) bird feed, housing and related products; (j) lawn and garden equipment (including but not

closed trailers; (o) 3-point equipment; and, (p) truck and trailer accessories (including truck tool boxes,

and trailer hitches and connections) (the "Restricted Products"). Nothing contained in this Lease shall

prevent any tenant on the Restricted Property from selling Restricted Products as an incidental part of its

other and principal business so long as the total number of square feet devoted by such tenant to the

display for sale of Restricted Products does not exceed five percent (5%) of the total number of square

feet of space used for merchandise display by such tenant (including one-half (1/2) of the aisle space

adjacent to any display area). Further, this covenant shall not apply to any business operated by Tenant,

or any affiliate of Tenant. "Restricted Property" shall mean any property within ten (10) miles of the

Demised Premises that is owned, controlled or developed by Landlord (or any entity in which Landlord, or

an equity holder of Landlord, holds an equity or management interest) for commercial purposes.

Decatur, TX FINAL LEASE

## Page 10
Landlord acknowledges that in the event of any breach of this Section 15 for which a

judgment of breach has been rendered in favor of Tenant, remedies at law would be inadequate.

Therefore, and in that event, Tenant shall be entitled to (i) continue this Lease on the same terms and

conditions that existed immediately before the violation, except that Tenant's rent and all future rent shall

be reduced by one-half (1/2) until such violation has ceased, and Landlord expressly authorizes such rent

reduction without further action by the parties; (ii) cancel this Lease without further obligation or liability to

Landlord; (iii) relief by injunction; and (iv) remedies at law, or otherwise, as Tenant may elect in its sole

discretion. Tenant's rights and remedies set forth in this Section 15 may be exercised in any order and in

any combination whatsoever. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Tenant is

intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be

cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at

law or in equity.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Tenant ceases to operate in the Demised

Premises for at least ninety (90) days or more (except in the event of a re-modeling, assignment, casualty

or condemnation, in which event the time period above shall be increased to one hundred eighty (180)

days so long as Tenant commences operations within such one hundred eighty (180) day period),

Landlord may enter into leases within the Restricted Property for the following uses: (i) a pet store up to,

but not exceeding, 6,000 square feet so long as the sales area for pet supplies does not exceed 750

square feet; and (ii) an automobile parts store of any size.

16. COMMON AREA. The entire tract of land on which Landlord has constructed the

Shopping Center is shown on Exhibit "B". The Site Plan designates the location and size of all buildings

constructed, store sizes, parking area, which shall be sufficient for adequate parking of customer cars,

customer parcel pickup facilities, and Tenant's delivery service areas. All that portion of the tract of land

not covered by buildings or the Demised Premises is the common area (the "Common Area") for the joint

use of all tenants, customers, invitees, and employees. Landlord agrees that it will not lease, allow to be

occupied or allow any other structure to be built on the "Critical Common Area" designated on the Site

Plan without the prior written consent of Tenant, which may not be unreasonably withheld. Additionally,

Landlord may construct a pad site of up to 5,000 square feet in the Common Area as shown on Exhibit

"B" ("Build Area") and in that event Tenant agrees that the occupant of any improvements constructed

on the Build Area shall have rights of access and parking on, over and across the Common Areas in

common with Tenant. Landlord agrees to maintain all Common Area in good repair, to keep such area

clean, to remove snow and ice therefrom, to keep such area lighted during hours of darkness when

Tenant is open for business, and to keep the parking area properly striped to assist in the orderly parking

of cars.

Tenant agrees to pay Landlord its pro rata share of Landlord's actual cost of care and

maintenance of the Common Area ("Common Area Expense"). Common Area Expense shall include,

lighting, sweeping, trash removal, parking lot maintenance and repair, mowing, landscaping, cleaning,

security (if provided by Landlord), maintaining, repairing and testing the fire sprinkler systems in the

Shopping Center, and snow removal, but shall not include capital repairs (except for resurfacing of the

parking lot no more frequently than once every ten (10) years), management or administrative fees, roof

repairs or replacement, or structural repairs. Tenant's pro rata share of Common Area Expense shall be

in the ratio that the number of square feet in the Building bears to the Leaseable Area.

Commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall make payments to

Landlord monthly in the amount of One Thousand Three Hundred Twenty Two and 71/100 Dollars

($1,322.71), which represents Landlord's good faith estimate of Tenant's pro rata share of Common Area

Expense; provided, however, for the first full calendar year of the Term of this Lease, Tenant's pro rata

share of Common Area Expense shall not exceed Sixteen Thousand Dollars ($16,000.00), and Tenant

shall have no liability or obligation for any excess. Tenant's pro rata share of Common Area Expense is

subject to a maximum increase of five percent (5%) over Tenant's pro rata share of the Common Area

Expense for the immediately preceding year. The costs of utilities for the common areas and snow and

ice removal expenses shall be excluded from the cap on Common Area Expense.

Decatur, TX FINAL LEASE

## Page 11
Within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant

a statement, and supporting documentation satisfactory to Tenant, setting forth with particularity the size

of the Leaseable Area, any changes in the size of the Leaseable Area during the calendar year and the

effective date of such changes, Tenant's pro rata share of Common Area Expense for the calendar year

just ended, and Tenant's payments made during the calendar year. If Tenant's pro rata share of

Common Area Expense exceeds the payments made by Tenant, Tenant shall pay Landlord the

deficiency within sixty (60) days after receipt of the statement and the supporting documentation

reasonably satisfactory to Tenant. If Tenant's payments made during the calendar year exceeds

Tenant's pro rata share of Common Area Expense, Landlord shall refund to Tenant the amount of the

overpayment along with the issuance of the statement. Commencing in the second calendar year of the

Term, Tenant's monthly payment shall be adjusted once annually to equal 1/12th of Tenant's actual pro

rata share of Common Area Expense for the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to the limits

set out above.

If Landlord does not issue its annual Common Area Expense statement (and supporting

documentation satisfactory to Tenant) within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of any calendar

year, Tenant may discontinue its monthly Common Area Expense payments until Landlord issues such

annual statement and supporting documentation reasonably satisfactory to Tenant. Tenant shall have no

liability for remitting monthly Common Area Expense payments for such time following the expiration of

the one hundred twenty (120) day period through the date Landlord's annual statement is actually

received by Tenant. Landlord's failure to submit to Tenant an annual statement (and supporting

documentation satisfactory to Tenant) for Common Area Expense within twelve (12) months after the end

of the calendar year shall nullify Landlord's right to collect from Tenant the reimbursement for that

particular calendar year and Tenant may take a credit against rent and other charges due under this

Lease for any sums already paid by Tenant for such calendar year.

Tenant's obligation for a pro rata share of Landlord's Common Area Expense shall be pro rated at

the beginning or end of the Term, for the period of time Tenant has rent obligations under this Lease

compared to the period of time covered by Landlord's Common Area Expense statement.

17.

REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE - LANDLORD.

Commencing on the Rent

Commencement Date and during the Term, Landlord shall maintain the Shopping Center, at its sole cost

and expense, in good condition and shall perform all necessary maintenance, repair, and replacement:

A.

to the structure and exterior of the Building, to the extent not the responsibility of

Tenant under Section 18, including but not limited to:

holes or other conditions that may compromise its utility and safety (certain expenses may be

included in Common Area Expense subject to the terms of Section 16);

(ii)

all exterior utility lines and pipes to the point of entry to the Building;

(iii)

all other structural portions of the Demised Premises.

D.

covered, or required to be covered, by Landlord's insurance obligations under

this Lease; and,

E.

necessitated due to the negligence or intentional misconduct of Landlord and/or

its agents, or other occupants of the Shopping Center, including items which would be Tenant's

responsibility under Section 18 but for such negligence or intentional misconduct, or due to Landlord's

failure to observe or perform any of its covenants or obligations under this Lease.

Landlord has the right and responsibility to enter the Demised Premises periodically, at

any reasonable time during Tenant's normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to

Tenant, to inspect the condition of the Demised Premises and to perform any maintenance, repairs or

replacements required to be performed by Landlord hereunder. Any maintenance, repairs, or

replacements by Landlord shall be performed so as to cause the least interference possible with Tenant's

business operation. If Tenant shall become aware of any maintenance, repair or replacement that may

be necessary and which is Landlord's obligation hereunder, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing.

Landlord shall complete any such maintenance, repair or replacement within thirty (30) days of the date of

Tenant's notice to Landlord (or sooner in the event of an emergency); provided, however, if any required

repair, restoration or replacement cannot be reasonably accomplished within such thirty (30) day period,

then Landlord shall commence same within such thirty (30) day period and diligently pursue same to

completion, but in no event shall such completion extend beyond sixty (60) days from Tenant's notice.

thereafter, once annually within thirty (30) days of the policy's expiration date. Landlord's

insurance shall contain a clause stating that there shall be no reduction, cancellation, or non-

bill Tenant within sixty (60) days of the date of Landlord's payment of premiums which billings

shall be accompanied by legible copies as of the paid premium invoices and such additional

information as may be necessary to calculate Tenant's pro rata share. If Landlord fails to bill

Tenant within twelve (12) months of the date of Landlord's payment of a premium, Tenant's

reimbursement obligation for that premium shall thereupon be extinguished. Tenant's obligation

for a pro rata share of Landlord's insurance costs shall be pro rated at the beginning and end of

the Term for the period of time Tenant has rent obligations under this Lease compared to the

period of time covered by Landlord's insurance policies. Landlord shall use due diligence and

good faith to obtain the insurance at a rate favorable to Tenant.

B.

severability of interest clause. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a certificate of insurance as evidence of

such coverage. Tenant may provide the insurance herein required in any blanket policy or policies which

it carries. All Tenant insurers shall have an A.M. Best rating of at least A- VIII. Provided Tenant

required to be carried, by Landlord. The obligations of this Subsection 21 A shall survive expiration or

termination of this Lease.

B.

Tenant Indemnification. Subject to Subsection 20 A, Tenant shall defend,

indemnify and save harmless Landlord and its directors, officers, partners, employees and agents

("Landlord Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, judgments, expenses,

fines, liabilities and losses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, paralegal fees, expert witness fees,

consultant fees, and other costs of defense) arising from or as a result of (i) any accident, injury, including

Commencement Date and during the Term caused by the negligence or misconduct of Tenant, its agents,

indemnities provided herein are ones of first defense and payment, not of reimbursement or surety and

shall in no way be limited by or to the amount of insurance carried, or required to be carried, by Tenant.

The obligations of this Subsection 21 B shall survive expiration or termination of this Lease.

22.

ENTRANCES. Tenant shall have unrestricted use and access to all streets, entrances,

passways, loading docks, and delivery lanes to the Demised Premises and easements adjacent thereto.

delivery lanes on or benefiting the Shopping Center and/or the Demised Premises without the prior

written consent of Tenant, not to be unreasonably withheld. If any street, right of way, or all or any part of

23.

UTILITIES. Tenant shall have the right to select its utility service providers, and shall pay

for all utilities used by it in the Demised Premises during the Term of this Lease. Landlord shall provide

any reasonable easements or licenses required by any utility providers for which Tenant seeks services

for the operation of its business, including internet or telecommunication services, within fifteen (15) days

after Tenant's request provided Landlord and Landlord's lender reasonably approve same.

24. TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS. Beginning on the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant

shall pay Landlord annually Tenant's pro rata share of tax payments for real estate, ad valorem and

special assessments (collectively the "Taxes") lawfully imposed against the Shopping Center for the then

current calendar year. Tenant's pro rata share shall be in the ratio which the number of square feet in the

Building bears to the Leaseable Area. Within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar year,

Landlord shall furnish Tenant a statement, and supporting documentation reasonably satisfactory to

Tenant, including (i) copies of all bills for Taxes for the Shopping Center, (ii) proof of Landlord's payment

of the Taxes, and setting forth with particularity the size of the Leaseable Area, any changes in the size of

the Leaseable Area during the calendar year and the effective date of such changes, Tenant's pro rata

share of Taxes for the calendar year just ended, and Tenant's payments made during the calendar year.

If Tenant's pro rata share of Taxes exceeds the payments made by Tenant, Tenant shall pay Landlord

the deficiency within sixty (60) days after receipt of the statement and the supporting documentation

reasonably satisfactory to Tenant. If Tenant's payments made during the calendar year exceeds

Tenant's pro rata share of Taxes, Landlord shall refund to Tenant the amount of the overpayment along

with the issuance of the statement. Commencing in the second calendar year of the Term, Tenant's

monthly payment shall be adjusted once annually to equal 1/12th of Tenant's actual pro rata share of

Taxes for the immediately preceding calendar year.

If Landlord does not issue its annual statement for Taxes (and supporting documentation

satisfactory to Tenant) within one hundred eighty (180) days after the end of any calendar year, Tenant

may discontinue its monthly payments for Taxes until Landlord issues such annual statement and

supporting documentation reasonably satisfactory to Tenant. Tenant shall have no liability for remitting

monthly payments for Taxes for such time following the expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day

period through the date Landlord's annual statement is actually received by Tenant. Landlord's failure to

submit to Tenant an annual statement (and supporting documentation reasonably satisfactory to Tenant)

for Taxes within twelve (12) months after the end of the calendar year shall nullify Landlord's right to

collect from Tenant the reimbursement for that particular calendar year and Tenant may take a credit

against rent and other charges due under this Lease for any sums already paid by Tenant for such

calendar year.

Tenant's obligation for a pro rata share of Landlord's Taxes shall be pro rated at the

beginning or end of the Term, for the period of time Tenant has rent obligations under this Lease

compared to the period of time covered by Landlord's statement for Taxes.

Landlord agrees to pay all Taxes before delinquency and shall further obtain all savings

offered for early payment. Tenant shall not be obligated to pay any portion of any penalty for delinquent

payment or for a saving which could have been realized for discounted early payment, provided Landlord

timely provides Tenant with the tax bill and Tenant timely pays its pro rata share of same. Tenant shall

have no obligation to pay, or liability for, any franchise, corporate, estate, inheritance, succession,

transfer, net income, AMT, or excess profits taxes or other similar taxes, whether currently existing or

imposed during the Term of this Lease. Any rollback taxes that may be or become due as the result of

any assessment based on a change in land use shall be Landlord's obligation.

25.

PERMITTED CONTESTS. Landlord agrees to copy Tenant on all notices that Taxes are

to be increased within seven (7) days of receipt of such notices. In the event Tenant, in its sole

discretion, determines to contest the proposed increase, it shall so notify Landlord within seven (7) days

of receipt of Landlord's notice. Landlord shall timely file all notices or other legal papers with the taxing

authority proposing the Tax increase to assert Landlord's right to contest the proposed Tax increase.

Landlord shall diligently contest the proposed Tax increase. Tenant shall pay its pro rata share of

Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in contesting the proposed Tax increase. Tenant's

pro rata share shall be the ratio which the number of square feet in the Building bears to the Leaseable

Area.

26.

ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. Tenant may sublet or assign the Demised Premises

at any time when the use by the subtenant or assignee shall not be in violation of any Permitted

Encumbrance. Tenant shall notify Landlord with the name of the subtenant or assignee within fifteen (15)

days of any subletting or assignment. Following any subletting or assignment, Tenant shall not be

relieved from any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, and shall remain primarily liable. After such

subletting or assignment, the word Tenant as used herein shall include any such subtenant or assignee.

27.

SIGNS. Landlord hereby approves Tenant's standard signs consisting of a store front

sign over the primary entrance to store and a free standing pylon sign, as described and depicted in

Exhibit "D" ("Tenant's Standard Signs"). Landlord and Tenant agree that Tenant's Standard Signs

shall be limited in size only by Tenant's discretion and applicable Laws, which may include any lawful

variance granted. If Tenant chooses to seek a variance, Landlord agrees to cooperate with Tenant in

securing such variance(s), including but not limited to signing any application and/or (if required)

appearing at any hearing or before any board or commission as may be required. Tenant shall be

responsible to obtain, at solely its cost and expense, any permit required for the installation of Tenant's

Tenant's business operation, Tenant may cancel this Lease or, at its option, retain that portion of the

Demised Premises not taken. In the event Tenant retains the Demised Premises, Landlord will promptly

day period Landlord shall have the right to pursue its legal and equitable remedies. (ii) Monetary

payment of rent or other charges properly due to Landlord, then after the expiration of the fifteen (15) day

single installment of Fixed Rent, wherein Tenant shall be authorized to offset any rent payments, Fixed or

otherwise, until it has been reimbursed for all costs and expenses associated with curing such default.

Any such offset shall not constitute a default by Tenant unless Tenant shall fail to pay the amount of such

offset to Landlord within ten (10) days after a final unappealable adjudication by a court of competent

jurisdiction that such amount is owing to Landlord. Except when in Tenant's reasonable judgment an

emergency shall exist, Tenant shall not commence to cure any default of a nature that could not

or for any specified number of hours per day or week, or to limit the number of hours per day or week that

Tenant may operate in the Demised Premises, or as creating an implied or expressed obligation upon

Tenant to continuously occupy or operate a business in the Demised Premises.

harmless the other party from and against any and all losses,

liabilities (including strict liability), damages, injuries, expenses,
